Hi, This is Chidera Okoma. Welcome to my website.


This is my second week in the Master of Data Science (Computational Linguistics) but it feels like two years ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜­. The program is really fast paced and challenging as well.

The goodnews is that I am learning a lot that means I am growing in knowledge and skill ðŸ˜Š.
